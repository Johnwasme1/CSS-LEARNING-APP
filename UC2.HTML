            <h2>Unit of Competency 2:     Setup Computer Network </h2>
            <p><strong>INSTALL NETWORK CABLES</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Learning Objective:</strong></p>
<p>After reading this INFORMATION SHEET, YOU MUST be able to crimp LAN cable, configure the system and check the connectivity of your work.</p>

<p>A network is a group of interconnected computers, linked for the purpose of sharing files, programs, and peripherals. Through your computers or office network, you can run programs, use printers, and edit files from other computers as if they were located on your own.</p>

<p>A server is the computer on the network that manages the network resources, such as the shared files, programs, and printers.</p>

<p>Local-area network (LAN) is a computer network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or group of buildings e.g. a school.</p>

<p>The majority of networking, particularly at the corporate level, is done using the internet standard. At the center of the basic diagram of a wired network is either a hub or a switcher and computers are connected to the hub, much like spokes of a wheel or star. Each connection at the hub is called a port.</p>

<p><strong>Three Basic Network Categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN):</strong> the smallest of the three network types, consists of PCs connected together within a limited area, such as within the same building, floor, or department.</li>
  <li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</strong> a network that spans no more than 50 miles, designed to connect LANs spanning a town or city.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN):</strong> used to distribute information thousands of miles among thousands of users.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Other network terms and types -->

<p><strong>The Basic Rule:</strong></p>
<p>The basic rule for network design is known as the 5-4-3 rule. It states that in a 10 Mbps Ethernet network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you can have a maximum of five cable segments between any two computers</li>
  <li>you can have a maximum of four repeaters (hubs, switches, wireless access points, etc.) between any two computers</li>
  <li>of the five cable segments (maximum) between any computers, only three of these can terminate in computers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Wire Ethernet Cables:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What You Need:</strong></p>
<p>Required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAT 5 Cable - bulk Category 5, 5e or 6 cable</li>
  <li>RJ45</li>
  <li>Crimper for RJ45</li>
  <li>Wire Cutters - to cut and strip the cable if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wire Stripper</li>
  <li>Cable Tester</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Cable:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Internal Cable Structure and Color Coding:</strong></p>
<p>Inside the cable, there are 8 color coded wires. These wires are twisted into 4 pairs of wires, each pair has a common color theme. One wire in the pair being a solid or primarily solid colored wire and the other being a primarily white wire with a colored stripe (Sometimes cable doesn't have any color on the striped cable, the only way to tell is to check which other wire it is twisted around).</p>

<p><strong>About the RJ45 Ends:</strong></p>
<p>The RJ45 end is a 8-position modular connector that looks like a large phone plug. There are a couple variations available. Here is a diagram and pinout:</p>

<p><strong>RJ45 Jack and Plug Pinout</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ethernet Cable Pinouts:</strong></p>
<p>There are two basic cables. A straight through cable, which is used to connect to a hub or switch, and a crossover cable used to operate in a peer-to-peer fashion without a hub/switch. Some interfaces can cross and un-cross a cable automatically as needed, really quite nice.</p>
